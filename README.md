# sql-challenge

Please find attached documents that cover the Module 9 Assignment Challenge.  An extension was granted by Kristina D'Alessio due to my illness.

The files attached are - 

The ERD for the task.

The sql file containing the code to create six tables.

A word file showing what is displayed in these tables (snips - it shows the first few rows, not neccesarily all of them), showing that the data was successfully imported and could be further interrogated.

The sql file containing the code to answer the questions for the data analysis.

A word file showing what is displayed after each of these queries is run. (snips - it shows the first few rows, not neccesarily all of them)
